    <briefdescription>
<para>In CGAL, we are trying as much as possible not to break the backward compatibility. </para>

<para>If we have to do it, it will be announced in the <ulink url="https://www.cgal.org/releases.html">release notes</ulink> , and a solution will always be provided. When possible, we keep the deprecated API for two releases before removing it. If you reached this page after clicking on a link, it must probably mean that the documentation page you were trying to reach is now deprecated. Have a look at the <ulink url="https://www.cgal.org/releases.html">release notes</ulink> for more information. </para>
